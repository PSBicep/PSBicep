# Contributing to Bicep PowerShell

You are more than welcome to contribute to the Bicep PowerShell module, whether it is [Pull Requests](#pull-requests), [Feature Suggestions](#feature-suggestions) or [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)!

## Getting Started

- Fork this repo (see [this forking guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for more information).
- Checkout the repo locally with `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/PSBicep.git`.
- Run the command `.\build.ps1 -ResolveDependency -Task build` to download the required dependencies and build the module.

### BicepNet

The Bicep PowerShell module uses a nested module named [BicepNet](https://github.com/PSBicep/BicepNet). BicepNet is a thin wrapper around Bicep that will load all Bicep assemblies in a separate context to avoid conflicts with other modules, like `Az PowerShell`. It is BicepNet that controls which Bicep version is used by the module. When a new Bicep version is released BicepNet must be updated before the Bicep module can leverage the new features.

### Structure

The repo is organized as below:

- **Classes** (`Source/Classes`): Home of all the classes used by the module.
- **en-US** (`Source/en-US`): Module help file location. Generated by `PlatyPS` from markdown help files in the Docs.
- **Private** (`Source/Private`): All private functions used by the module.
- **Public** (`Source/Public`): All functions exported by the module.
- **Tests** (`Tests`): Pester tests executed at Pull Request.
- **scripts** (`scripts`): Script file location used by Github Actions and to update assemblies when developing locally.
- **Help** (`Docs\Help`): Markdown help files for external help.

### Running the module locally

- Download the assemblies needed by the module by running the command `.\build.ps1 -ResolveDependency -Task build`:

```
.\build.ps1 -ResolveDependency -Task build
```

- Import the module:

```powershell
Import-Module .\Source\Bicep.psd1
```

### platyPS

[platyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) is used to write the external help in markdown. When contributing always make sure that the changes are added to the help file.  
A slightly modified version of platyPS is downloaded and used by the build script. The build script will also update markdown files and generate external help.

Make sure to edit the markdown file(s) in the `.\Docs\Help` folder and populate `{{ ... }}` placeholders with missed help content.

### Tests

[Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) is the ubiquitous test and mock framework for PowerShell. We use it for automatic testing and it executes at Pull Requests. We have a lot improvements to do on the test front and contributions are more than welcome. The progress can be tracked [here](https://github.com/PSBicep/PSBicep/issues/22).
