# Contributing to Bicep PowerShell

You are more than welcome to contribute to the Bicep PowerShell module, whether it is [Pull Requests](#pull-requests), [Feature Suggestions](#feature-suggestions) or [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)!

## Getting Started

- Fork this repo (see [this forking guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for more information).
- Checkout the repo locally with `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/PSBicep.git`.
- Run the script `.\scripts\downloadDependencies.ps1` to download the required dependencies:
  - Nested module [BicepNet](https://github.com/PSBicep/BicepNet) to the BicepNet.PS (`Source/BicepNet.PS`) folder.
  - Bicep Types information to the Assets (`Source/Assets`) folder.
- If you haven't already, you will need the [PlatyPs](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) PowerShell Module to generate command help and docs.

## Developing

### BicepNet

The Bicep PowerShell module uses a nested module named [BicepNet](https://github.com/PSBicep/BicepNet). BicepNet is a thin wrapper around Bicep that will load all bicep assemblies in a separate context to avoid conflicts with other modules, like `Az PowerShell`. It is BicepNet that controls which Bicep version is used by the module. When a new Bicep version is released BicepNet must be updated before the Bicep module can leverage the new features.

### Structure

The repo is organized as below:

- **Classes** (`Source/Classes`): Home of all the classes used by the module.
- **en-US** (`Source/en-US`): Module help file location. Generated by `PlatyPS` from markdown help files in the Docs.
- **Private** (`Source/Private`): All private functions used by the module.
- **Public** (`Source/Public`): All functions exported by the module.
- **Tests** (`Tests`): Pester tests executed at Pull Request.
- **scripts** (`scripts`): Script file location used by Github Actions and to update assemblies when developing locally.
- **Help** (`Docs\Help`): Markdown help files for external help.

### Running the module locally

- Download the assemblies needed by the module by running the `downloadDependencies.ps1` script:

```
.\scripts\downloadDependencies.ps1
```

- Import the module:

```powershell
Import-Module .\Source\Bicep.psd1
```

### platyPS

[platyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) is used to write the external help in markdown. When contributing always make sure that the changes are added to the help file.

#### Quickstart

- Install the platyPS module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com):

```powershell
Install-Module -Name platyPS -Scope CurrentUser
Import-Module platyPS
```

- Create initial Markdown help file for `Bicep` module (This will only create help files for new commands, existing files will not be overwritten):

```powershell
# you should have module imported in the session
Import-Module .\Source\Bicep.psd1
New-MarkdownHelp -Module Bicep -OutputFolder .\Docs\Help
```

Edit the markdown file(s) in the `.\Docs\Help` folder and populate `{{ ... }}` placeholders with missed help content.

- Update the external help from markdown help

```powershell
New-ExternalHelp .\Docs\Help -OutputPath .\Source\en-US\ -Force
```

- If you've made a lot of changes to the module code, you can easily update the markdown file(s) automatically with:

```powershell
# re-import your module with latest changes
Import-Module .\Source\Bicep.psd1 -Force
Update-MarkdownHelp .\Docs\Help
```

### Tests

[Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) is the ubiquitous test and mock framework for PowerShell. We use it for automatic testing and it executes at Pull Requests. We have a lot improvements to do on the test front and contributions are more than welcome. The progress can be tracked [here](https://github.com/PSBicep/PSBicep/issues/22).
