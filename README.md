# ![BicepIcon] Bicep - PowerShell Module
[![Bicep]][BicepGallery] [![BicepDownloads]][BicepGallery]

This is the repository for the Bicep PowerShell Module. This is a community project created to enable the features provided by the [Bicep CLI](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) in PowerShell. The module provides the same functionality as Bicep CLI, plus some additional features to simplify the Bicep authoring experience.

Commands implemented:

- [Build-Bicep](./Docs/Help/Build-Bicep.md)
- [ConvertTo-Bicep](./Docs/Help/ConvertTo-Bicep.md)
- [Get-BicepVersion](./Docs/Help/Get-BicepVersion.md)
- [Get-BicepApiReference](./Docs/Help/Get-BicepApiReference.md)
- [Install-BicepCLI](./Docs/Help/Install-BicepCLI.md)
- [Update-BicepCLI](./Docs/Help/Update-BicepCLI.md)
- [Uninstall-BicepCLI](./Docs/Help/Uninstall-BicepCLI.md)
- [Update-BicepTypes](./Docs/Help/Update-BicepTypes.md)
- [Convert-JsonToBicep](./Docs/Help/Convert-JsonToBicep.md)

>**Note:** Starting with version `1.3.0` of the Bicep PowerShell module the cmdlets `Build-Bicep` and `ConvertTo-Bicep` uses the assemblies from the official [Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) repository instead of wrapping the Bicep CLI. When new Bicep versions are released there will be a slight delay before the PowerShell module gets tested updated with the latest assemblies. If new functionality is added to Bicep CLI before the PowerShell module supports it, use `Install-BicepCLI` to install the latest Bicep CLI version and use the CLI while waiting for an updated PowerShell module.

## Installation

The Bicep PowerShell Module is published to [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Bicep/).

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Bicep
```
